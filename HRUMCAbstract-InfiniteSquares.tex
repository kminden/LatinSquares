In this talk I will introduce Latin and Vatican squares (e.g. completed Sudoku puzzles). I will consider natural generalizations of Vatican squares from the finite to the infinite (infinite Sudoku puzzles?), and hint at how to construct infinite Vatican squares using Cayley tables of groups, as well as non-group based infinite Vatican squares. These results are based on joint work with Anthony B. Evans, Gage N. Martin, and M. A. Ollis.
